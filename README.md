# SensorLogger
A "real time" dataset generator using device sensors and camera

## Purpose
This Android app is stil a prototype, mainly for educational purposes. 
The aims of the project are:
- to mantain as far as possible the corrispondence between frames and sensor data
- configurable to be lightweight and not memory/battery consuming
- as fast as possible!

## Features
- Record frames (video) and sensor data
- Stream both images and sensors to a remote client
- Upload to FTP
- Save locally on the phone
- Rotate sensor axes
- All of the above, together!

## Usage
Just start the app. To begin a recording session you can either:
- just launch the python client. The app is preset to automatically start streaming
- click the volume button
- tap the screen
- try any other button you may have.... it may work

More options to enjoy in the settings :)

## Build
The app uses OpenCV. There are 2 options to build the app

### Standard build
OpenCV will be linked through the OpenCV Manager app. You will be prompted to install it if you don't have it.

### Native build
If you donÂ´t want to bother installing more stuff, in this case you will need to ship the correct native libraries together with OpenCV module. To do this just uncomment the `ndk` section in the app `build.gradle`
```gradle
ndk {
    moduleName "sensor-logger"
    abiFilters 'armeabi-v7a', 'arm64-v8a'
}
```
and the `sourceSets` section in the openCVLibrary module:
```gradle
sourceSets {
    main {
        jniLibs.srcDirs "sdk/native/libs"
    }
}
```
where the path of `jniLibs.srcDirs` is where you will need to put the OpenCV static libraries (not included here) of your choice.

## Python client
A simple python client is provided to capture the streaming of both sensors and images (because with a browser you can only access a video stream).
This is actually pretty slow, being implemented with matplolib, but is a good starting point for collecting and make use of "real-time" data within a data science python application
